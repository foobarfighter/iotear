Benchmarking
============
Basic
[ ] Add framework for creating repeatable tests in different configurations
    [ ] Framework should be able to repeat tests on different OSes
    [ ] Framework should be able to repeat tests on ruby versions
    [ ] Framework should be able to repeat tests with different run times
    [ ] Framework should be able to repeat tests using different threading models

[ ] Add hooks for plotting results of different benchmarks
    [ ] Benchmarks are repeatable
    [ ] Benchmarks generate HTML pages with graphs

Computation
[ ] Run benchmarks against windows/ruby 1.8.7
[ ] Run benchmarks against macosx/ruby 1.8.7
[ ] Run benchmarks against windows/ruby 1.8.7
[ ] Run benchmarks against macosx/ruby 1.9.1
[ ] Run benchmarks against linux/ruby 1.8.7
[ ] Run benchmarks against linux/ruby 1.9.1

Threading models:
=================
[ ] Thread pool

Threading models with I/O:
==========================
[ ] Asynch I/O with workers in thread pool
